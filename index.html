<h3>Steroid Controversy</h3>
<p>Despite his achievements, McGwire’s career became overshadowed by the steroid era in baseball. In 2010, he admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his playing career, including the 1998 season. While he expressed regret and stated the drugs were meant to aid recovery, not boost power, the revelation tarnished his reputation and likely cost him induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
